Deformable object manipulation remains a challenging task in robotics.
Continuous, high dimensional, state and action spaces make standard
model-based approachs to manipulation planning intractable. Recent work
has shown progress on this task by learning from
demonstrations through 
\emph{trajectory transfer}~\cite{Schulmanetal_ISRR2013, Schulmanetal_IROS2013}. This 
approach avoids planning in the state space of a deformable object
by finding a spatial warping that can be used to apply an expert demonstration
to a new scene.

We propose a method for improving trajectory transfer that makes use of bootstrapping
example through simulation. Given a simulator and a way to detect success, we augment
our trajectory library with example states and transferred trajectories that have succeeded
in simulation. We apply this approach to a simulated overhand knot-tying task. The
approach described in Schulman et al.~\cite{Schulmanetal_ISRR2013} acheives a success rate
of 59\%. We demonstrate performance of up to 85\%.
