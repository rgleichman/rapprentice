  \caption{Success rate of tying a knot using the expert-labeled examples. The neareast-neighbor method selects
           the demonstration that minimizes a bi-directional registration cost associated with the trajectory transfer.
           Other policies maximize the approximate Q-function we learn through \mmql{}. Greedy maximizes this value in the current
           state. The lookahead policies act to maximize a back up value computed by beam search with the specified parameters. The greedy
           succeeds in an additional 17\% of examples when compared with the baseline. Lookahead policies achieve very high performance rates
           and approach the best possible with our demonstration library.}
